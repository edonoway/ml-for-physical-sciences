``pocoMC`` is a Python implementation of `Preconditioned Monte Carlo (PMC)`.
Using ``pocoMC`` one can perform Bayesian inference, including model comparison, 
for challenging scientific problems. ``pocoMC``'s sophisticated `normalizing flow
preconditioning` procedures enables efficient sampling from highly correlated posterior
distributions. ``pocoMC`` is designed to excel in demanding parameter estimation
problems that include multimodal and highly non--Gaussian target distributions.

.. admonition:: Where to start?
    :class: tip

    üñ• A good place to get started is with the :doc:`install` and then the
    :doc:`pages/quickstart` guide. If you are not familiar with Bayesian inference
    or how PMC works have a look at the :doc:`background`.

    üìñ For more details, check out the :doc:`advanced` and :doc:`tutorials`,
    including the full :doc:`api` documentation.

    üí° If you're running into problems getting ``pocoMC`` to do what you want, first
    check out the :doc:`faq` page, for some general tips and tricks.

    üêõ If :doc:`faq` doesn't solve your problems, or if you find bugs,
    then head on over to the `GitHub issues page <https://github.com/minaskar/pocomc/issues>`_.

    üëà Check out the sidebar to find the full table of contents.
